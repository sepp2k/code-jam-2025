# Interactive HTML Tutorial

An interactive web-based HTML tutorial application that teaches HTML through hands-on Python coding exercises. Built with `PyScript`, this educational tool allows users to write Python code using HTML helper functions and see their HTML output.

This project was created as part of Python Code Jam 2025, where the theme was Wrong Tool for the Job.

Check it out [here](https://sepp2k.github.io/code-jam-2025/)

**Key Value**: Learn HTML by writing Python code instead of raw HTML markup, with instant feedback and validation.

## The Idea

Our entry takes the form of an HTML Tutorial but with a twist: Instead of writing HTML, users write Python code to complete each exercise. For example, rather than typing:

```html
<div>Hello <em>World</em>!</div>
```

the user writes:

```python
div("Hello ", em("World"), "!")
```

The Python code is then executed directly in the browser to generate the HTML, which is displayed alongside the code editor. Each chapter introduces a new HTML concept, followed by exercises that can only be solved by writing Python that outputs the correct HTML structure.

## Why This Fits the Theme

Arguably PyScript is always the wrong tool for the job, but more importantly the project is about teaching HTML, but we're making the user write Python instead. We're therefore forcing the wrong tool for the job on the user. This mismatch captures the spirit of the Code Jam's theme while also making for an engaging, "playful" learning experience.

It's also a fun exploration of "Python in the browser". Everything&mdash;tutorial logic, code execution, and validation&mdash;is written in Python. The user writes Python, the site runs Python, and all of it ultimately produces HTML (Plus CSS and JavaScript). The HTML files themselves contain only a basic HTML structure and everything else (meaning all of the pages' contents) is generated by running Python in the browser (which also happens to be the wrong tool for the job).

## Demo

Live Demo: [Coming Soon]

## Example Usage

1. Select an exercise

2. Write your solution in the editor, something like this:

    ```python
    # Write Python code like this:
    div(h1("My Title"), p("Some content"))
    ```

3. Click submit to see the HTML preview, and validation feedback.

## Features

- Interactive Code Editor with Python syntax highlighting (powered by CodeMirror).
- HTML Preview.
- Validation to check exercise requirements.
- Error Handling with helpful error messages.
- Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` for quick submission).
- Responsive Design with resizable interface panels.
- Educational Feedback showing success/failure with specific guidance and hints.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- Internet connection (for PyScript and external dependencies).

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sepp2k/code-jam-2025.git
    cd code-jam-2025
    ```

    > No additional Python packages required - runs entirely in the browser via PyScript

2. Serve the files using a local web server:

    - using python's `http.server` (requires Python3+):

        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```

    - or using Node.js:

        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```

### Running the Application

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Start with the exercises page to begin learning.

## Usage Guide

### Navigation

1. **Home**: HTML tutorial information.
3. **Exercises**: Interactive exercises.

### Available HTML Helper Functions

To pass an exercise, you need to write Python code that mirrors the HTML structure requested by the exercise. To do that, you should use the available Python helper functions to create HTML elements. The functions take the form: `html_tag_name(content, *children, **attributes)`.

- `content`: the text content of the tag
- `*children`: a list of HTML elements of tags that are appended as children to the current tag
- `**attributes`: key-value attributes that are added to the tag

#### Examples

- A simple HTML header tag:

    ```python
    h1("Hello World")
    ```

- A paragraph tag:

    ```python
    p("foo bar")
    ```

- An anchor tag (tag with attributes):

    ```python
    a("google", href="https://www.google.com/")
    ```

- A tag with nested children:

    ```python
    div(
        h1("HTML Tutorial"),
        div(
            p("Paragraph Tag", id="exercise-title"),
            p("Write two paragraphs, each having at least 2 words.", "exercise-description"),
            id="exercise-area-"
        ),
        id="main-container"
    )
    ```

#### Available Helper Functions

- `h1()`: Header 1 element
- `h2()`: Header 2 element
- `div()`: Div element
- `p()`: Paragraph element
- `br()`: Line break element
- `em()`: Emphasis element
- `textarea()`: Textarea element
- `button()`: Button element
- `iframe()`: Iframe element
- `nav()`: Nav element
- `a()`: Anchor element
- `code()`: Code element
- `span()`: Span element
- `b()`: Bold element
- `img()`: Image element
